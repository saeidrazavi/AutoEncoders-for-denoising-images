# AutoEncoders for denoising images

## what are AutoEncoders?

AutoEncoder is an unsupervised learning Algorithm used typically for dimensionality reduction (data compression), AutoEncoder is a Neural Network with a specific Architecture like bellow :

in this repo, we use images of mnist dataset, add guassian noise to them at first, and then make a nerual network using pythorh, to denoise the noisy images 

### how to add noise to images?
